- **User Stories**: Collecting user stories to understand how different users will interact with the BI system and what they expect from it.

### Use Cases
- **Business Scenarios**: Defining specific scenarios and use cases that the BI solution needs to support.
- **Functional Requirements**: Documenting the functionalities required to support these scenarios and use cases.

## Data Requirements

### Data Sources

- **Timeliness**: Ensuring data is up-to-date and available when needed.
- **Validity**: Verifying that data adheres to defined formats and constraints.

### Data Governance
- **Policies and Procedures**: Establishing policies and procedures for data management and quality assurance.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Defining roles and responsibilities for data stewardship and governance.

### Quality Assurance Processes
- **Data Profiling**: Analyzing data to understand its structure, content, and quality issues.
- **Data Cleansing**: Implementing processes to detect and correct errors and inconsistencies.
- **Quality Metrics**: Defining metrics to measure and monitor data quality.

## Conclusion

Defining business, data, and quality requirements is a critical step in the success of any Business Intelligence initiative. By understanding business goals, engaging stakeholders, identifying data sources, and ensuring high data quality, organizations can create a robust BI solution that delivers actionable insights and supports strategic decision-making. Clear requirements help in aligning the BI solution with organizational objectives and ensure that it meets the needs of all users.
